# IBM-Data-Analyst-Capstone-Project
<br>
Course 9 of 9 of IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate
<br><br>
<p>The jupyter notebook files - modified and running from my Anaconda environment, because I prefer working in my laptop (not depends on the internet connectivity). Unfortunately, I can't upload the csv and sqlite file because it's too large for the github free account. Certain lines of code maybe add/modified from the original, to adapt some near deprecated function or to make properly running using Anaconda.</p>
<p>Spend a lot of time to make my IBM Cognos Embedded Dashboard to be fully running, because I have accident unintentionally delete the object storage. I spend hours to connect my IBM Cloud Object Storage to IBM Watson Cloud Data Pak which connect to IBM Cognos Embedded dashboard. After everything running, I also spend hours to make my IBM Cognos Dashboard peer-graded assignment on weeks 5 to be more beautiful and stunning. I also upload the <a href="ibm data analyst c9w5.json">JSON</a> file for the Cognos dashboard deployment.</p>
